   1. I like how the code is organized. It's more intuitive to have the template 
    first and then the script and styles. I think this is the convention too!

   2. I like how you have a third toggle option for seeing just in-progress projects.

   3. The only suggestion is to have a more intuitive way to have the user know that 
   they have three toggle options.

   Awesome work!

   Also, thanks for your helpful peer review!
